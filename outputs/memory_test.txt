SYNTHESIZED ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
Based on my research, I found the following information:

**Neural Networks:**
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
The main types include: CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer
These are commonly used for: image recognition, NLP, time series

SYSTEM METRICS:
----------------------------------------
Overall Confidence: 0.50
Success: True
Agents Involved: 2

AGENT EXECUTION DETAILS:
----------------------------------------
MEMORY AGENT:
  Confidence: 0.90
  Execution Time: 0.118s
  Memory Hits: 0

RESEARCH AGENT:
  Confidence: 0.30
  Execution Time: 0.000s
  Topics Found: neural_networks

EXECUTION TRACE:
----------------------------------------
Step 1: memory_agent
  Status: SUCCESS
  Time: 0.000s

Step 2: memory_agent
  Status: SUCCESS
  Time: 0.118s

Step 3: research_agent
  Status: SUCCESS
  Time: 0.000s

MEMORY SYSTEM STATUS:
----------------------------------------
Conversations Stored: 0
Knowledge Entries: 0
Storage Path: memory_storage

AGENT COLLABORATION SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
This scenario demonstrated multi-agent coordination where:
- Research Agent retrieved relevant information from knowledge base
- Memory Agent stored/retrieved conversation context
- Coordinator orchestrated the entire process and synthesized results
